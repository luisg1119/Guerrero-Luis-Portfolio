# Perl Code

## What this is

Through this project I introduced myself to Perl and gained a further insight in different programming styles. The application itself creates a file with random text utilizing specific Top Level Domain names (TLDs). After the file is created the program reads the file and sorts the TLDs to output another file which has sorts both TLDs extentions and names to keep uniformality.
