Question that Triangle.java solves:
By starting at the top of the triangle below and moving to adjacent numbers on the row below, the maximum total from top to bottom is 23.

3 <br>
7 4 <br>
2 4 6 <br>
8 5 9 3 <br>

That is, 3 + 7 + 4 + 9 = 23.


Find the maximum total from top to bottom from the triangle.txt file


Quick Set Up:
To use triangle.java put triangle.txt at the root of the folder where the program is 
being ran.
